"""
* 1. Look at the image bananasplit.png

* 2. Your mission is to create a python program that recreates that image
     using the create_text function
     
* 3. The catch is, you can only type the create_text function ONE TIME ONLY
     into your program. Using a loop and if-statements, you must figure out
     how to vary the text and the positioning so that you can read all four
     separate lines.

Text Rendering Example:
                    x    y                                                       
canvas.create_text(100, 50, text="text goes here", font=("Arial", 16))
'''
# Put your code below
for x in range(0, 4):
    if x != 3:
        text = "ice cream"
    else:
        text = 'banana'
    canvas.create_text(100, 50+ (x*20), text=text, font=("Arial", 16))
